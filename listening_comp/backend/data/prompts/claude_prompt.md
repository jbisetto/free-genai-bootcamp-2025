# Prompt for Extracting Question Types 2 and 4 from JLPT N5 Listening

Please analyze the following JLPT N5 listening practice transcript and extract ONLY questions of Type 2 (Conversation Comprehension Questions) and Type 4 (Listening Comprehension Without Visual Aids).

## JLPT N5 Listening Question Type Definitions:

- **Type 1 (Picture/Option Selection)**: Questions where you listen to a conversation and select the best answer from visual options (often pictures). These usually involve situations like "Where is the man going?" with images to choose from. IGNORE THESE.

- **Type 2 (Conversation Comprehension)**: Questions where you first hear a question, then listen to a conversation, and select the best answer based on understanding specific details from the dialogue. Examples include questions about birthdays, meeting locations, food choices, etc. EXTRACT THESE.

- **Type 3 (Situational Response)**: Questions that show a situation and ask for the appropriate phrase to use (e.g., "You're going to sleep. What do you say to others?"). These test knowledge of common Japanese phrases in context. IGNORE THESE.

- **Type 4 (Pure Listening Comprehension)**: Questions without any visual aids where you listen to a question and select the appropriate response. These rely solely on listening comprehension without contextual clues. EXTRACT THESE.

## Important Notes:
- **Ignore video intro and outro sections** and any practice examples
- **Only extract questions that match Type 2 or Type 4 criteria**
- Type 2 questions often appear in sections labeled "問題2" in the transcript
- Type 4 questions often appear in sections labeled "問題4" in the transcript

## Question [counter of extracted questions] 

**Type:** [Question Type]
