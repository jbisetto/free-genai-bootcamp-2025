# Prompt document
## v001
Initial creation taking inspiration from Damian's Spanish to English example video
### Response Evaluation
- provided conjugation hints in the clues
- first attempt told me i needed to conjugate in the past tense.
- i asked for an explaination of conjugations in italian and it basically gave me the answer and used the Italian terms for some grammar terms like passed tense, "For "jumped," we need the past tense (passato prossimo) in Italian"

## v002
#2 v002 add clue restirction's on tense and conjugation and ask to not use italian words for grammar terms
### Response Evaluation
- better hints and no use of italian for grammar terms
- still providing part of the answer when i ask about conjucations and still using passato prossimo
- hit the free limit, switch to a lower free model
## v003
Will leave the prompt here for now since the model switched on me
Future work:
- fix the use of Italian in side bar questions
- fix giving the answer in the side bar
- try to get it to use a similar example i.e. instead of cat use dog, etc
- may need to do this with bad examples in the prompt

## Used Claude assisted prompt
- used "the cat jumped over the moon"
- didn't provide translation for "over" in the vocabulary table but did in the clues.
- nice use of emojis
```Now, please try translating the sentence into Italian! ðŸ˜Š```
- on second attempt it started to give some of the translation away but did give suggestions on how to change correct parts so that they are more natural sounding
- once grammatically correct it provided changes for natural flow with reasons why and italian to english translations for the changes
